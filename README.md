# Ranger

An [Arch](https://archlinux.org)-based mostly-general-purpose emergency/recovery/installation ISO.

Requires [archiso](https://github.com/archlinux/archiso) and `erofs-utils` to build the ISO, and `dd` to write the ISO to a bootable disk/USB/whatever.

## Building the ISO

`./build.sh`, then run `./install.sh <device file>`.
